**ALX Shell Project**

**Description**
The ALX Shell project developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The project aims to create a simple shell program that emulates basic shell functionalities. The shell provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the underlying operating system and execute various commands.

**Features**
The ALX Shell Project includes the following features:
1. **Command Execution**: Users can input commands, and the shell executes them by creating the child processes.
2. **Built-in Commands**: The shell support built-in commands like 'exit' to terminate the shell and 'env' to display environment variables.
3. **Path Resolution**: The shell resolves command path by searching through directories listed in the PATH environment variables.
4. **Tokenization**: User input is tokenized, allowing for better command processing execution.
5. **Whitespace Stripping**: The shell removes leading and trailing whitespaces from user input and reduces multiple spaces between tokens to a single space.
6. **Environment Variables printing**: The shell can display the current environment variables using the 'env' command.

**Usage**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the shell program using a C compiler. For example:
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic main.c functions.c -o hsh
3. Run the shell program:
./hsh
4. Once the shell is running, you can input various commands and interract with the shell as you would with a regular shell.
